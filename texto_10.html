			<h1>Unas de cal y otras… También</h1>
			<p><em>Como en las otras regiones de la Colombia Rural Posconflicto la deficiente calidad de la educaci&oacute;n, del sistema de salud y de la infraestructura vial y de transporte requiere soluciones inmediatas.</em></p>
			<p>Menos de la mitad (48.8%) de los habitantes de la regi&oacute;n Cordillera Central est&aacute;n satisfechos con la calidad de las escuelas p&uacute;blicas. Este, seg&uacute;n el estudio de la Colombia Rural Posconflicto 2017, es uno de los indicadores que m&aacute;s cay&oacute; con respecto a 2015, cuando se ubic&oacute; en 68.2%. El porqu&eacute; del dr&aacute;stico descenso no encierra mayor misterio de acuerdo con quienes viven en esta zona del pa&iacute;s. &ldquo;<em>Mis hijos tienen que caminar una hora de ida y otra de regreso, cada d&iacute;a, para ir al colegio, y luego para regresar a su casa. Cuando llegan al colegio, hay supuestamente tres grados diferentes, pero todos est&aacute;n el mismo sal&oacute;n</em>&rdquo;, dice Amalia*, habitante de una vereda de Santander de Quilichao.</p>

			<p>Quienes est&aacute;n tomando alg&uacute;n curso de formaci&oacute;n t&eacute;cnica dicen no correr con mejor suerte. Juanita* y Adriana* deben viajar desde Caloto, la primera, y desde Corinto, la segunda, para llegar a la sede del Sena de Santander de Quilichao, porque en sus municipios esta instituci&oacute;n no funciona. &ldquo;<em>Y nos toca estudiar lo que haya, porque no hay mucho de d&oacute;nde escoger: para poder hacerlo hay que irse a Cali y la mayor&iacute;a de nosotros no contamos con los recursos para costearnos ni los transportes, ni los estudios y mucho menos la estad&iacute;a en esa ciudad</em>&rdquo;.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
			
			<div class="burbuja margin_btm">
				<div class="mensaje">
					&ldquo;Los ni&ntilde;os est&aacute;n todos metidos en un sal&oacute;n. Donde caben <span>20</span>, meten <span>50</span>. La excusa es que las paredes se est&aacute;n cayendo; que los techos en cualquier momento se desploman&rdquo;.
				</div>
			</div>

			<p>Los instructores del Sena coinciden en algunos de estos reparos y confirman que muchos de los estudiantes se inscriben a los cursos porque son gratis, &ldquo;<em>no porque les guste, sino porque no tienen nada que hacer. Y deber&iacute;an aprovechar esta oportunidad para formarse como l&iacute;deres de sus comunidades, pero la mayor&iacute;a se desmotiva r&aacute;pidamente porque consiguen empleos de baja calidad o porque la estabilidad laboral que les ofrecen es m&iacute;nima y puede que no duren all&iacute; m&aacute;s de tres meses</em>&rdquo;. Agregan que es necesaria la integraci&oacute;n del Sena con otras entidades e instituciones p&uacute;blicas, as&iacute; como con el sector privado. &ldquo;<em>Nosotros aqu&iacute; podemos capacitar a un joven en hacer sandalias, pero si &eacute;l no sabe de mercadeo, de emprendimiento, de contabilidad y, si no hay un mercado que demande ese producto, la formaci&oacute;n es in&uacute;til, porque ni ayuda a la autonom&iacute;a econ&oacute;mica de este joven ni se beneficia la econom&iacute;a del municipio o del departamento. Lo que se genera es m&aacute;s desempleo</em>&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>Dos problemas m&aacute;s que afectan a las instituciones educativas de Cordillera Central son el de la deficiencia en infraestructura y la inexistencia de programas de formaci&oacute;n superior profesional. Sobre el primero, muchos padres est&aacute;n cansados de que sus hijos reciban clases, todos los d&iacute;as, hacinados. &ldquo;<em>Los ni&ntilde;os est&aacute;n todos metidos en un sal&oacute;n. Donde caben 20, meten 50. La excusa es que las paredes se est&aacute;n cayendo; que los techos en cualquier momento se desploman. Y si a eso le suman cada vez que los profesores se van a la huelga, pues los ni&ntilde;os no aprenden nada, pierden tiempo y se atrasan en comparaci&oacute;n con los que est&aacute;n en un colegio privado</em>&rdquo;, dice Hern&aacute;n*, sobre lo que ocurre en la escuela de su vereda, en el municipio de Rioblanco.</p>
			<p class="margin_btm">Manuel*, por su parte, est&aacute; preocupado porque no es posible que la &uacute;nica alternativa para cursar estudios universitarios sea ir a Popay&aacute;n o a Cali o, si le llega un golpe de suerte, emprender el viaje hasta Bogot&aacute;. &ldquo;<em>En Corinto no existe ninguna oferta de educaci&oacute;n superior. Aqu&iacute; todo se acaba cuando uno se grad&uacute;a del bachillerato. Se queda sin opciones. Si usted no tiene plata para irse a las ciudades, para pagar techo, comida y un semestre en una universidad, pues est&aacute; fregado, porque en estos pueblos no hay mucho que hacer. O se puede dedicar a recorrer el pueblo, calle arriba, calle abajo o, en el peor de los casos, se va a raspar hoja de coca y lo que venga despu&eacute;s</em>&rdquo;.</p>

			<div class="notice">Mal diagn&oacute;stico</div>

			<p>El sistema de salud tambi&eacute;n les genera dolores de cabeza constantes a los habitantes de la regi&oacute;n Cordillera Central. Solo el 32% de sus habitantes est&aacute; satisfecho con este servicio, seg&uacute;n el estudio Colombia Rural Posconflicto.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;<em>Estamos jodidos con la salud. No hay especialistas; hay pocos m&eacute;dicos generales; los servicios en los hospitales son malos. Para que a uno lo atiendan hay que pasarle plata al empleado de turno.&nbsp; Y si est&aacute; muy enfermo, le toca viajar a Cali, porque aqu&iacute; se muere antes de tiempo</em>&rdquo;, explica Joaqu&iacute;n*, due&ntilde;o de una finca a las afueras de Pradera.</p>
			<p>Hugo* asegura que, en su municipio (Caloto), ocurre los mismo, pero asume parte de la responsabilidad. &ldquo;<em>Nosotros tambi&eacute;n tenemos la culpa. Nos quejamos de la corrupci&oacute;n, de que se roban la plata y de que no ponen ni un ladrillo. Pero, &iquest;Qui&eacute;nes los subieron al poder? Nosotros mismos, que les vendemos nuestro voto y solo pensamos en la inmediatez de la plata que nos dan por eso, para luego pasar cuatro a&ntilde;os quej&aacute;ndonos del d&eacute;ficit en educaci&oacute;n, en salud, en todo. Pero eso s&iacute;, en la siguiente votaci&oacute;n, volvemos a negociar</em>&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>Por cuenta del mal estado de las v&iacute;as, los habitantes de la regi&oacute;n dicen estar tambi&eacute;n aislados. Solo el 26.8% de ellos est&aacute; satisfecho con la infraestructura vial y de transporte. &ldquo;<em>Aqu&iacute; seguimos en tiempo de la Colonia. Los caminos de herradura con los que contamos son los que salen cada rato en los noticieros, cuando un bus escalera se va al abismo. Y en cada elecci&oacute;n viene un pol&iacute;tico a prometer pavimentaci&oacute;n, ampliaci&oacute;n de la carretera, pero lo eligen y por ac&aacute; no se vuelve a aparecer</em>&rdquo;, analiza Ferney*, habitante de Miranda.</p>

			<p>Para otros ciudadanos, como Luc&iacute;a*, quien vive en Rioblanco hace m&aacute;s de 30 a&ntilde;os, es evidente que detr&aacute;s de todos estos males est&aacute; la corrupci&oacute;n. &ldquo;<em>Se roban los recursos que llegan al municipio. Esto hace que no haya desarrollo y, as&iacute;, no mejoran ni los servicios p&uacute;blicos, ni las oportunidades laborales ni educativas para los j&oacute;venes, a quienes no les queda otro camino que la delincuencia. Aqu&iacute; la inversi&oacute;n social es completamente antisocial, porque quienes se roban la plata p&uacute;blica est&aacute;n en contra del desarrollo de estos pueblos. Ellos solo agarran su bot&iacute;n y se olvidan del resto. Si uno no est&aacute; con un pol&iacute;tico, no est&aacute; nada</em>&rdquo;.</p>
